# Items
item.neo-mod-neocromium.name = Neocromium
item.neo-mod-neocromium.description = The ultimate strucuture material, impervius to all sorts of physical damage, although it can be melted with enough heat
item.neo-mod-neocromium.details = It's weird properties allow it to reflect 100% of the kinetic energy aplied to it
item.neo-mod-adamantite.name = Adamantite
item.neo-mod-adamantite.description = A fragile material, it may be weaker than glass but it's heat absortion capabilities are unheard of
item.neo-mod-adamantite.details = Preliminary test suggest that it might impossible to even make it glow red using current tecnology, maximum temperature archived on test: [orange]5.5 trillion Â°K
item.neo-mod-neoadamantite.name = Neoadamantite
item.neo-mod-neoadamantite.description = The combination of neocromium and adamantite, combining adamantites heat inmunity with neocromium damage inmunity creates the ultimate material
item.neo-mod-neoadamantite.details = [scarlet]Important note: []both materials must be added and casted immediately since after cooled it can't be modified further
item.neo-mod-neoadamantite-frame.name = Neoadamantite Frame
item.neo-mod-neoadamantite-frame.description = A casted frame made form neoadamantite, used in multiple buildings as a base
item.neo-mod-neoadamantite-frame.details = Mixing it with different materials will allow it to have extra properties

# Blocks
block.neo-mod-neo-extractor.name = Neo Extractor
block.neo-mod-neo-extractor.description = Uses slag to melt neocromium from under the surface and pump it back up for later usage
block.neo-mod-neo-extractor.details = It can be placed anywhere since, apparently, neocromium is really common under the surface of the planet
block.neo-mod-adamantite-breaker.name = Adamantite Breaker
block.neo-mod-adamantite-breaker.description = Using the impact drill tecnology from erekir is capable of mining adamantite out of the floor
block.neo-mod-adamantite-breaker.details = After the conquer of erekir it was a matter of time until you found a usage for some of the tecnology back in serpulo
block.neo-mod-neo-fuser.name = Neo Fuser
block.neo-mod-neo-fuser.description = Taking adamantite and melted neocromium it cast it both into neoadamantite ingots and frames
block.neo-mod-neo-fuser.details = You thought of making these in two separate machines but decided to make it in only one to conserve space

# Liquids
liquid.neo-mod-melted-neocromium.name = Melted Neocromium
liquid.neo-mod-melted-neocromium.description = Neocromium that has been melted, this being the only way to use it
liquid.neo-mod-melted-neocromium.details = Since it can't be damaged even as a raw ore, neocromium needs to be melted and casted into the shape wanted for construction\nor mixed with other material to change it's properties
