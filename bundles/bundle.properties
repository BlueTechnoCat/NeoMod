# Blocks

## Production
block.neo-mod-1-1-neo-extractor.name = Neo Extractor
block.neo-mod-1-1-neo-extractor.description = Uses slag to melt neocromium from under the surface and pump it back up for later usage
block.neo-mod-1-1-neo-extractor.details = It can be placed anywhere since, apparently, neocromium is really common under the surface of the planet
block.neo-mod-1-2-adamantite-breaker.name = Adamantite Breaker
block.neo-mod-1-2-adamantite-breaker.description = Using the impact drill tecnology from erekir is capable of mining adamantite out of the floor
block.neo-mod-1-2-adamantite-breaker.details = After the conquer of erekir it was a matter of time until you found a usage for some of the tecnology back in serpulo

## Crafting
block.neo-mod-2-1-neo-cooler.name = Neo Cooler
block.neo-mod-2-1-neo-cooler.description = It takes the melted neocromium and cast it into ingots for use as ammunition or unit making
block.neo-mod-2-1-neo-cooler.details = It's usage in unit relies on the fact that it can be melted allowing it to be reshaped 
block.neo-mod-2-2-neo-fuser.name = Neo Fuser
block.neo-mod-2-2-neo-fuser.description = Taking adamantite and melted neocromium it cast it both into neoadamantite ingots and frames
block.neo-mod-2-2-neo-fuser.details = You thought of making these in two separate machines but decided to make it in only one to conserve space
block.neo-mod-.name = Adamantite Coolant Mixer
block.neo-mod-.description = Mixing admantite with water makes a cooling liquid far superior to cryofluid
block.neo-mod-.details = It usage on turrets has shown excellent results, if a bit much since it caused basic turret to dissasemble from the sheer shooting speed

## Defense
block.neo-mod-3-1-neo-thorium-wall.name = Neo Thorium Wall
block.neo-mod-3-1-neo-thorium-wall.description = A thorium wall with a neoadamantite frame as a base, it deflects bullets by default
block.neo-mod-3-2-neo-thorium-wall-large.name = Neo Thorium Wall Large
block.neo-mod-3-2-neo-thorium-wall-large.description = A thorium wall with a neoadamantite frame as a base, it deflects bullets by default. Spans multiple tiles
block.neo-mod-3-3-neo-plastanium-wall.name = Neo Plastanium Wall
block.neo-mod-3-3-neo-plastanium-wall.description = A plastanium wall with a neoadamantite frame as a base keeping it's laser absorbing properties, it deflects bullets by default
block.neo-mod-3-4-neo-plastanium-wall-large.name = Neo Plastanium Wall Large
